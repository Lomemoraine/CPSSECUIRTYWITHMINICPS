# WaterTreatment simulation WITH MINICPS FOR CPS SECURITY RESEARCH

MiniCPS is a framework for Cyber-Physical Systems real-time simulation. It
includes support for physical process and control devices simulation, and
network emulation. It is build on top of
[mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet).

MiniCPS is developed by the [SCy-Phy](http://scy-phy.github.io/index.html)
group from SUTD (Singapore University of Design and Technology).
